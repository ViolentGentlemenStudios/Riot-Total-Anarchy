# Riot: Total Anarchy
*A Violent Gentlemen Studios Game*

Riot: Total Anarchy is the flagship game of Violent Gentlemen Studios.

You know how authority figures are always nagging that video games are too violent
and cause real life violence? We seek to break that stereotype... by making the 
most comically excessively violent game we can come up with!
